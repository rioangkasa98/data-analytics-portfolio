# Coffee Shop Sales & Product Performance Analysis

## Background
This project analyzes the performance of a coffee shop by exploring both overall sales behavior and detailed product-level patterns. The goal is to transform raw transactional data into meaningful insights that can help business owners understand customer habits, identify strong product categories, and uncover opportunities to improve revenue.
The analysis focuses on two perspectives: **Sales Overview** to understand the shop’s general performance, and **Product Analysis** to evaluate what items drive the most contribution

## 📌 Problem Statement
The coffee shop has consistent customer traffic, but the business lacks clarity on which products contribute most to revenue, which time periods generate the highest sales, and how customer buying patterns shift across categories.
Without this understanding, it becomes difficult to make decisions about product prioritization, promotions, staffing, and pricing.
This project aims to uncover these patterns through a structured data analysis approach.

## 🔍 Objective
The main objectives of this project are:
- To monitor sales performance through key indicators such as total revenue, transactions, and peak activity.
- To identify customer purchasing patterns over time.
- To determine top-selling products and category contribution.
- To provide actionable insights that help optimize pricing, promotion strategies, and product offerings.

### Key Insights

1. **Strong monthly sales performance with clear peaks**
Revenue shows noticeable spikes in **March** and **October**, indicating seasonal or promotional periods where customer purchases significantly increase. This pattern highlights the months with the highest business activity.
    
2. **Coffee category dominates overall revenue**
Coffee contributes **over 80%** of total sales, making it the primary revenue driver. Non-coffee products play a much smaller role, signaling that the shop’s core value proposition is strongly coffee-driven.

### Key Insights

1. **Latte is the top-selling product**
Latte outperforms all other products with the highest total sales, followed closely by Americano with Milk. This suggests customers prefer milk-based beverages, and these items should be highlighted in promotions or bundles.
    
2. **Coffee products contribute the majority of category revenue**
The Coffee category contributes more than 80% of total product revenue. This reinforces that the product lineup is heavily skewed toward coffee demand, and optimizing this category will have the most noticeable business impact.

## Actionable Business Recommendations

Here are several practical recommendations that the coffee shop can apply based on the findings:

**A. Boost Revenue During Peak Months**

1. Launch limited-time seasonal drinks in March and October to maximize existing spikes.
2. Increase marketing activity during these months (e.g., social media ads, bundle promotions).

**B. Strengthen Top-Selling Products**

1. Create drink bundles featuring Latte and Americano with Milk.
2. Introduce size upgrades or add-ons (extra shot, flavored syrup) for best sellers.

 **C. Enhance Coffee Category Performance**

Since coffee contributes 80%+ of revenue, consider:

1. Introducing new coffee variations (cold brew, flavored lattes).
2. Testing premium pricing for specialty coffee items.
3. Offering loyalty rewards specifically for coffee purchases.
