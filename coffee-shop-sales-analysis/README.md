# Coffee Shop Sales & Product Performance Analysis

## Background
This project analyzes the performance of a coffee shop by exploring both overall sales behavior and detailed product-level patterns. The goal is to transform raw transactional data into meaningful insights that can help business owners understand customer habits, identify strong product categories, and uncover opportunities to improve revenue.
The analysis focuses on two perspectives: **Sales Overview** to understand the shop’s general performance, and **Product Analysis** to evaluate what items drive the most contribution

## 📌 Problem Statement
The coffee shop has consistent customer traffic, but the business lacks clarity on which products contribute most to revenue, which time periods generate the highest sales, and how customer buying patterns shift across categories.
Without this understanding, it becomes difficult to make decisions about product prioritization, promotions, staffing, and pricing.
This project aims to uncover these patterns through a structured data analysis approach.

## 🔍 Objective
The main objectives of this project are:
- To monitor sales performance through key indicators such as total revenue, transactions, and peak activity.
- To identify customer purchasing patterns over time.
- To determine top-selling products and category contribution.
- To provide actionable insights that help optimize pricing, promotion strategies, and product offerings.
